## Wilkommen!

This little demo project will help you get acquainted a little bit with GraphQL and how it compares to REST.

## Setting up

- Clone the project.
- `cd graphql-tutorial`
- `make startbg`
- `make fixtures`

You should now have a working Dockerized Django project with a PostgresQL database.
